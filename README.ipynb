For example, with $i = 180$ and $j = 212$, we will say that these values are highly correlated if a large number of pixels are worth $180$ in the image 1 and $212$ in the image 2. The mutual image information calculates these values for each gray level combination ($i = 0...255$ and $j = 0...255$ for 8-bit images).
